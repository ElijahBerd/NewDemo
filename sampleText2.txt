Hey, darling
I know you think my love is slipping away
But, baby, it's all in your mind (Yes)
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind (Yeah. Yeah. Ooh)

Believe me
I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer, my darling
Feel the love in my eyes (Yes)
